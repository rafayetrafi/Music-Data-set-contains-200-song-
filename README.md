# Music-lyrics-Data-set-contains-200-song-
We have 200 English song. In the preprocessing part we have remove the verse, chorus and some digits that defines the repetition of that lyrics. Because these verse, chorus and digits are not impactable on title recommendation. We also elaborate the contraction word. After doing that, we have used modified LDA algorithm and from there we determine the percentage of words from a lyrics line. We pick the sentence as the title of the song which sentence contains the greater percentage of word.
